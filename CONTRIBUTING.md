# Contribution Guidelines 🎯

**-> Create a new issue about the project you want to add!**

**-> Wait for the issue to be assigned and then create the Pull Request.**

We welcome contributions from all levels of experience, including immediate beginners. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to clone the repository and create a pull request:


## How to make a pull request?

**1. Fork the repository.**


In order to contribute to the repository, first you need to fork the repository by `Forking` the repository.


```
Fork the repository!
```

**2. Clone the repository.**

To clone the repository, open a terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<Your Username>/ip2d.git
```

This will create a copy of the repository on your local computer.

**2. Create a new branch.**

To create a new branch for your changes, run the following command:

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with a descriptive name for your branch.

**3. Make your changes.**

Make your changes to the code and test them thoroughly.

**4. Commit your changes.**

Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch. To do this, run the following command:

```
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Replace `<commit-message>` with a short description of your changes.

**5. Push your changes to GitHub.**

To push your changes to GitHub, run the following command:

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**6. Create a pull request.**

Once you have pushed your changes to GitHub, you can create a pull request to merge your branch into the main codebase. To do this, go to the GitHub repository and click on the **Pull requests** tab. Then, click on the **New pull request** button.

Select your branch as the **Head** branch and the `main` branch as the **Base** branch. Then, click on the **Create pull request** button.

**7. Wait for review.**

Once you have created a pull request, one of the maintainers of the repository will review your changes. If they have any questions or suggestions, they will leave a comment on the pull request.

**8. Make changes as needed.**

If the maintainer has any questions or suggestions, make the necessary changes to your code and push them to your branch.

**9. Merge your pull request.**

Once the maintainer is happy with your changes, they will merge your pull request. This will merge your branch into the main codebase and your changes will be published.

**Additional Tips**

* Be sure to read the README before making any changes.
* If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue or ask for help on the discussion board.
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes! Everyone makes mistakes, and we are here to help you learn from them.
